# Project-0 : LLMOps
I am walking through some key steps for taking an LLM-based pipeline to production. This pipeline will be familiar to - previous modules: **Summarization of news articles** using a pre-trained model from Hugging Face.

Steps: 
1. Walk through a simple but realistic workflow to take an LLM pipeline from development to production.
2. Make use of MLflow Tracking and the Model Registry to package and manage the pipeline.
3. Scale out batch inference using Apache Spark and Delta Lake.
